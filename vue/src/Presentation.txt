-Create a futuristic pizza ordering website for hungry club- and partygoers in Tech Elevator City for our wonderful 
angel investor and entertainment mogul, Frank Franklin. Party-people hungry for pizza should be able to log in and 
make and modify an order, and of course, live in the moment.

//Identify users// 
We built this website and application with late-nights and neon in mind. 
The colors and styling reflect fun, retro-futurism, and of course, an easy 
ordering process. 

Without further ado, we present: NAMELESS PI *queue music and GLASSES ON*

Marina
//Illustrate a user story through the demo//
The login process helps you seamlessly transition from the dance floor. And if you don't have an account, you can get registered. 

Choose your username that speaks to your soul and a super-secure password. 
**MUSIC STARTS - WAIT FOR VOLUME TO GO DOWN**

And, while you're filling out the registration, there's even more jams to keep you hyped. 

And the good vibes continue at our main splash page. GLASSES OFF, PIZZA HAT BACK ON

Party people can use these buttons to jump to the menu, order page, backstory, and contact information. 
Here's our founder and inspiration, Frank Franklin. Obviously you want to know more about him.

We used AI to help tell the Nameless Pi story, and styled his celestial journey in a carousel.
From burnt-out tech icon...to making major progress with his life coach, Luna Echo...Nameless Pi has taken over the pizza ecosystem in tech elevator city...
And I bet you're wondering how we timed this so seamlessly. Users can mouse over the images to pause the carousel and read the story. 
And if any of you would like to read the full backstory, we will share the link after the presentation.

Call or send us a message to start talking about how you can disrupt the pizza ecosystem. 

Dan 
It's hard to be a disruptor on an empty stomach though, so let's order 
some of this amazing pizza!

Our menu features an array (!) of delicious specialty pies, with 
classics such as our OG Nameless, featuring cheese, black truffle, and gold leaf. 
It's making me hungry, so let's order one. 

Our order page allows users to choose their own size, sauce, and crust, 
and automatically selects the toppings for specialty pizzas.

David
But let's add another one--let's 
create our own custom pizza. (make custom with additional instructions)

Anastassia
Okay we're back in the cart: All our pizzas and their information are 
populated automatically, so we're ready to check out. Our checkout page
imports the information we registered with. Customers can choose pick-up 
or instore, input their payment info, and submit their order. Totally cool.

Marina
After seeing the amazing pizzas from Nameless Pi, we hope you're excited to 
join our pizza empire.

Dan **GRADUATION HAT ON**
And now we'd like to open up for questions.
