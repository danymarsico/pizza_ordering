//State project objective// 
-Create a futuristic pizza ordering website for hungry club- and partygoers in Tech Elevator City for our wonderful angel investor and entertainment mogul, Frank Franklin. Party-people hungry for pizza should be able to log in and make and modify an order, and of course, live in the moment.

//Identify users// 
We built this website and application with late-nights and neon in mind. The colors and styling reflect fun, retro-futurism, and of course, an easy ordering process. Without further ado, we present: NAMELESS PI *queue music*

//Illustrate a user story through the demo//
The login process helps to you seamlessly from the dance floor. And if you don't have an account, you can get registered. 
And the good vibes continue at our main splash page. Here's our founder and inspiration, Frank Franklin. Party people can use these buttons to jump to the menu, order page, backstory, and contact information. 

David 
So obviously you want to know more about our founder, Frank Franklin.

We used AI to help tell the Nameless Pi story, and styled his celestial journey in a carousel. From burnt-out tech icon, to making major progress with his life coach, Luna Echo, Nameless Pi has taken over the pizza ecosystem in Tech Elevator city.

It's hard to be a disruptor on an empty stomach though, so let's order some of this amazing pizza!

Our menu features an array (!) of delicious specialty pies, with classics such as our OG Nameless: cheese and gold leaf--amazing. It's making me hungry, so let's order one. 

David 
Our order page allows users to choose their own size, sauce, and crust, and automatically selects the toppings. Let's add another one--and this energetic website is inspiring me, let's create our own custom pizza. (make custom with additional instructions)

Anastassia
Let's go back to the cart: All our pizzas and their information are populated automatically, so we're ready to check out. Our checkout page imports the information I registered with. Customers can choose pick-up or instore, input their payment info, and submit their order. Totally cool.

Marina
After seeing the amazing pizzas from Nameless Pi, we hope you're excited to join our pizza empire.

Dan
And now we'd like to open up for questions.
